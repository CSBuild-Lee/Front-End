## Angry Bugs

Angry Bugs is an MUD game that was created during the Computer Science portion of Lambda School. 

### How It Works

1. The game allows players to create an insect, which is assigned a random and amusing name. Next, they are redirected to an instructions component that explains the rules (in short: destroy as many crops as you can before turning into a butterfly).

2. Players must keep their calorie count as low as possible, as this influences how soon their metamorphisis begins. The best strategy is to eat leafy vegetables like lettuce first while saving starchy options such as potatoes or yams for last.

3. Movement is made possible by a back-end that attaches directional options -- up, down, left, and right -- to keyboard strokes and button clicks on the front-end.
