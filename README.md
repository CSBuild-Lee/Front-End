# Front End

This will become an actual ReadMe meant to be consumed later. For now, I'm using it as a planning document. Stuff that needs to happen regardless of the direction we take this project:

1. Create React App.
2. Log-in/sign-up components.
3. Protected route for the game.
4. Navigation (home, about, log-in/sign-up).
5. State management (Redux actions and reducers).
6. Wrap the index <App> in <Provider store={store}>.
7. Install dependencies needed for the above (redux, axios, react-router-dom, etc.)
                       
If nobody's opposed, I might do this stuff myself over the weekend just so we have a base structure as I need practice with React anyway. And then we can divvy out the little things on Monday.
